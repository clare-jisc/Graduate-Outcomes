<div class="grid-container"><div class="grid-row"><div class="column-12">    <h2>Notice: Change of controller</h2>

<p>On 4 October 2022 the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) merged with <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Jisc</a>. HESA is now part of Jisc. Jisc is a <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/about/corporate/company-and-charity-details" target="_blank">not-for-profit company</a> limited by guarantee, registered in England (company number: 05747339; charity number: 1149740).</p>

<p>Any personal data processed by HESA as controller has now transferred to Jisc under the purposes set out in this collection notice and Jisc is now the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/controllers-and-processors/controllers-and-processors-a-guide/" target="_blank">Controller</a> of this personal data. References to &lsquo;HESA Information&rsquo; in this privacy notice means data controlled by Jisc.</p>

<p>Jisc is the controller of the Graduate Outcomes website and of any processing described on it, unless otherwise indicated. This means it is Jisc who determines the manner and purpose of processing.</p>

<p>Under UK data protection laws, we are required to provide you with certain information about who we are, how we process your personal data and for what purposes and your rights in relation to your personal data. This information is provided in this collection notice. It is important that you read this information.</p>

<p>Details of how to exercise your data protection rights can be found in this <a href="https://www.graduateoutcomes.ac.uk/privacy-info#rights">collection notice</a>. If you have any queries about how your personal data is processed, please contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#62060316034c12100d160701160b0d0c220a0711034c03014c1709"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="35515441541b45475a415056415c5a5b755d5046541b54561b405e">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>In July 2021, the decision was taken to move to a single collection notice for graduates to cover all survey years. These notices are available both in English and Welsh.</p>

<p>This change was affected to make the notices more accessible and transparent to data subjects. The notices link to specific records across the Graduate Outcomes survey years. Jisc is now the controller of this personal data. If you need any assistance in identifying which record your &lsquo;HESA information&rsquo; may be included in, please contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e387829782cd93918c978680978a8c8da38b869082cd8280cd9688"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="54303520357a24263b203137203d3b3a143c3127357a35377a213f">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> for guidance.</p>

<p>Copies of the historic notices continue to be made available on the <a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/about/regulation/data-protection/notices/previous" target="_blank">Historical Collection Notices page</a>.</p>

<p>We welcome any feedback on these published notices.</p>

<hr />
<p>The Graduate Outcomes survey is a UK-wide survey capturing information about the activities and perspectives of graduates 15 months after they finish their studies. All eligible are asked to take part in the survey, in order to help current and future students gain an insight into career destinations and development. Your responses will also help your university or college to evaluate and improve their courses.</p>

<p>The survey is also of national significance as it allows policy makers, charities, journalists, researchers and others to understand the higher education sector and the state of the graduate labour market.</p>

<p>Jisc processes information about UK and other nations&rsquo; data subjects, including EU data subjects. Accordingly, all uses of HESA information must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;) (including UK and EU versions) and the Data Protection Act 2018 (&ldquo;DPA&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The survey asks about what you were doing in a particular week (the census week) about 15 months after you completed a Higher Education (HE) course, and which activity was most important to you (e.g. working, studying, caring, traveling). Further questions ask for more details depending on what you specified as the most important activity.</p>

<p><strong>Additional banks of questions may be included at the request of your university or college (&lsquo;higher education&rsquo; or &lsquo;HE&rsquo; provider) and these will be clearly signposted.</strong></p>

<p>Some questions depend on the type of course you completed, for example there are special questions for newly qualified teachers and postgraduate researchers.</p>

<p>If you were working during the census week, the survey also asks about your salary.</p>

<p>Some questions are designed to elicit the &lsquo;graduate voice&rsquo; &ndash; giving you the chance to share your own assessment about the value of your course and the personal importance of what you&rsquo;re doing now.</p>

<p>Other questions ask about your general wellbeing. These aren&rsquo;t part of the core questions and you don&rsquo;t have to share this information. Your HE provider won&rsquo;t receive your answers to these questions in a way that identifies you (they will only get summaries of responses overall for their graduates as a group, not individually). Your answers will be provided to the public authorities in a way that identifies you, in line Purpose 2 of this privacy notice.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Your survey responses are linked to data about when you were a student and these collectively make up &ldquo;your HESA Information&quot;. Jisc is now the controller of your HESA Information.</strong></p>

<p><b>A full list of data items that may be included in your HESA Information is made available for each survey year below. If you need any assistance in identifying which records your HESA information may be included in, please contact </b><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#680c091c0946181a071c0d0b1c01070628000d1b0946090b461d03"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="adc9ccd9cc83dddfc2d9c8ced9c4c2c3edc5c8decc83ccce83d8c6">[email&#160;protected]</span></a><b> for guidance.</b></p>

<p>If you are a graduate who obtained a relevant HE qualification during the reporting period and whose study was full-time or part-time (including sandwich students and those writing-up theses) who are notified to Jisc or the relevant body, you will be surveyed based on the reporting periods in the table below.</p>

<p>The Reporting Period indicates the date on which you obtained your applicable qualification. The Collection Year indicates the survey year in which your &lsquo;HESA Information&rsquo; is intended to be collected. For example, if you obtained your applicable qualification between 1 August 2022 to 31 July 2023, you will be invited to take part in the survey between December 2023 to November 2024.</p>

<p>Jisc identifies eligible graduates ahead of each Collection Year from the Student and Student Alternative collections. The Student Collection Notice provides further information regarding the use of personal data for the purpose of student and leaver surveys: <a href="https://www.hesa.ac.uk/about/regulation/data-protection/notices" target="_blank">https://www.hesa.ac.uk/about/regulation/data-protection/notices</a>.</p>

<p>For further education colleges in England and Northern Ireland eligible graduates are identified by the Office for Students and Department for the Economy (Northern Ireland), respectively. For these graduates, Jisc will also receive fields necessary for monitoring equality of opportunity and eliminating unlawful discrimination, including information about ethnicity and disability status.

The funding and regulatory bodies commission the Graduate Outcomes survey and require Jisc and HE providers to work together to deliver the survey. Jisc employs an organisation called IFF Research to undertake the Graduate Outcomes survey by phone.</strong></p>

<p>HE providers are required to give information to funding and regulatory bodies in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (see <b>Purpose 2 </b>below).</p>

<p>Some of this information is collected by Jisc on behalf of these bodies (<a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/about" target="_blank">www.hesa.ac.uk/about</a>).</p>

<p>In England, Jisc is the Designated Data Body and will use the information collected from the survey for its statutory functions under section 64 and section 65 of the Higher Education and Research Act 2018 (<a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/29/contents/enacted" target="_blank">http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2017/29/contents/enacted</a>).</p>

<p>For more information on Jisc&rsquo;s role within the statutory frameworks of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, please visit the HESA website: <a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/about/what-we-do/statutory-w-s-ni" target="_blank">https://www.hesa.ac.uk/about/what-we-do/statutory-w-s-ni</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to its statutory functions, Jisc also acts as an information hub of HE data and statistics for research purposes. Details of Jisc&rsquo;s information sharing activities are set out in this notice. Jisc is a Controller of your information. Jisc is a registered charity and operates on a not-for-profit basis.</p>

<p>IFF Research is a&nbsp;<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/controllers-and-processors/controllers-and-processors-a-guide/" target="_blank">Processor</a> working on behalf of Jisc to administer the Graduate Outcomes survey by phone.</p>

<p>Sometimes an HE provider&rsquo;s circumstances change so that it isn&rsquo;t compulsory to survey their graduates. In this case, the HE provider and Jisc might agree to continue with the Graduate Outcomes survey for the provider&rsquo;s graduates where this is in the public interest.</p>

<p>Jisc receives data about HE students in the UK. The HE provider you attended sent your contact details either to HESA before it merged with Jisc and your contact details transferred to Jisc when HESA and Jisc merged, or your contact details were sent by your provider directly to Jisc after HESA and Jisc merged. Your HE provider sent your contact details so that you can take part in the Graduate Outcomes survey as described in the <a href="https://www.hesa.ac.uk/about/regulation/data-protection/notices" target="_blank">Student Collection Notice</a>.</p>

<p>If you studied at a further education college in England your contact details were provided to Jisc from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/education-and-skills-funding-agency" target="_blank">Education and Skills Funding Agency</a> (ESFA) via the Office for Students (OfS) through the Individualised Learner Record (ILR). Further education colleges can also provide your contact details to Jisc directly.</p>

<p>If you received a loan or grant from the Student Loans Company (SLC), they may also have provided us with your contact details so that we can compare these with those received from your higher education provider or further education college and ensure we are using the most accurate information to send you the Graduate Outcomes survey.</p>

<p>Prior to 4 October 2022 your contact details were provided to HESA. HESA transferred these contact details to Jisc when both entities merged in October 2022.</p>

<p>Your contact details are only used by Jisc and its data Processors to conduct the Graduate Outcomes survey and copies are deleted by each organisation when they are no longer needed for the survey. We anticipate that this will be approximately 12 months after the last cohort of each year&#39;s graduates have been surveyed to allow for any audit or re-survey that might be required by the funding and regulatory bodies, or any additional analysis related to the quality of the contact details. For example, for those graduating in 2020/21, contact details are likely to be deleted in December 2023.</p>

<p>HE providers will receive regularly updated information from survey responses during the survey period. This includes coded information on industries and occupations of employed graduates. This information may only be processed for the purpose of monitoring the progress of the Graduate Outcomes survey.</p>

<p>The survey asks if you are happy to be contacted by your HE provider in relation to your survey answers. If you answer &lsquo;No&rsquo; then your provider may only use your survey answers for research and statistical purposes and they won&rsquo;t need to contact you with further privacy information.</p>

<p>If you answer &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; then your provider may contact you, in relation to any of the information you give in the survey.

Information supplied by Jisc to third parties within Purpose 5 is supplied under contracts which require that individuals shall not be identified from the supplied information, and this means that they also cannot use it to take decisions about you.</p>

<p>Each Jisc agreement for the supply of tailored information specifies the duration for which data may be processed. This is usually one year but may be longer, if necessary, for the specific research purpose. Each request for tailored information under Purpose 5 is assessed for its compliance with data protection legislation and its compatibility with this Collection Notice. Jisc ensures that only the minimum amount of HESA Information necessary for the specified research purpose is supplied to users. If the supplied information is to be published the <a href="https://www.hesa.ac.uk/about/regulation/data-protection/rounding-and-suppression-anonymise-statistics" target="_blank">HESA Rounding Methodology</a> or an equivalent disclosure control must be applied to ensure that individuals cannot be identified from the published material and it does not constitute Personal Data.</p>

<p>Each Jisc agreement for access to Heidi Plus specifies the purpose for which the data may be processed.</p>

<p>Processing within this Purpose 5 is carried out by Jisc. Other Controllers (listed under Purpose 2 and 3 above) may also process data for this purpose where this is necessary to fulfil their public functions.</p>

<p>Sometimes an HE provider&rsquo;s circumstances change so that it isn&rsquo;t compulsory for it to participate in the survey. In this case, the HE provider and Jisc (following consultation with relevant Statutory Customers) might agree to continue to allow the return of data by the provider for their graduates where this is considered to be in the public interest. Should the status of the provider change so that it becomes compulsory to submit student data to Jisc, this will be collected under Purpose 1.</p>

                            <p><strong>Data protection legislation gives you rights over your personal data. These include rights to know what information is processed about you and how it is processed. These rights have to be met by Jisc and any other organisation which takes decisions about how or why your information is processed.</strong></p>

<p>You have the right to be informed about how your personal data is used. This Graduate Outcomes privacy notice is regularly reviewed to ensure that it accurately describes how your HESA Information is used. This notice may be updated from time to time, for example when new legislation is enacted, or when new policies are implemented by the public authorities listed under Purposes 2 and 3. The most up to date version can always be found at <a href="https://www.graduateoutcomes.ac.uk/privacy-info">www.graduateoutcomes.ac.uk/privacy-info</a>, and historic versions can be found at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/about/regulation/data-protection/notices/previous" target="_blank">www.hesa.ac.uk/about/regulation/data-protection/notices/previous</a>.</p>

<p>For further information about data protection, including contact details for Jisc&rsquo;s Data Protection Officer please see <a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/dataprot" target="_blank">www.hesa.ac.uk/dataprot</a>. If you have questions about how your HESA Information is used, please contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fb9f9a8f9ad58b89948f9e988f929495bb939e889ad59a98d58e90"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="75111401145b05071a011016011c1a1b351d1006145b14165b001e">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>

<p>Under the GDPR, you have the right of access to your personal information. You also have: rights to rectify inaccurate information, restrict processing, or object to processing; and the right to be forgotten (i.e. to seek erasure of your personal data). These rights are limited in certain circumstances. Jisc will be able to implement erasure requests if they are made before 1 January 2024 for the current survey year (i.e. for leavers from the 2021/22 academic year). From that date onwards, it will not be possible for Jisc to implement erasure requests: Jisc will rely on GDPR Article 17(3)(b) and (d), as a basis for refusing your request.</p>

<p>If you do not want to complete the survey, there is no obligation to do so. If you don&#39;t want to be contacted at all for the survey please email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#563f38303916312437322337223339232235393b332578373578233d"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="deb7b0b8b19eb9acbfbaabbfaabbb1abaabdb1b3bbadf0bfbdf0abb5">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>

<p>The survey may request your consent for your provider to contact you regarding your survey responses. If you wish to withdraw this consent at any point please email <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0c65626a634c6b7e6d68796d78696379786f6361697f226d6f227967"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="d9b0b7bfb699beabb8bdacb8adbcb6acadbab6b4bcaaf7b8baf7acb2">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
